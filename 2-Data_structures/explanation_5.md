## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
The idea behind this implementation was that a linked list  
would be the most appropriated choice to create a blockchain.  
With a linked list it was possible to add a new block in constant time. 

## Time Efficiency:
The time efficiency of this implementation to add a new block  
is $O(1)$, appending a new block to the front of the list.

## Space Efficiency:
The space efficiency of the implementation of this blockchain is  
$O(n)$ as the more blocks the chain has, the space will grow linearly.
