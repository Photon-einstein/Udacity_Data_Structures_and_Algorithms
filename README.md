# Udacity_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms

## Intro
This course has the goal of teaching Data Structures and Algorithms in a more structured way, with a hands on approach.

## 1. Project Unscramble
This project consist of several tasks, working in inputs from two files containing data from text messages and voice calls
in the city of Bangalore.    
The analysis of run time complexity of the solutions is also included here as well, Big O notation.

## 2. Data Structures
This project consists of facing several problems using suitable data structures so that the time and space complexity of  
the solutions can be of hight standards. Several test cases were also created to ensure the proper correctness of the code.
Space and time complexity analysis reasoning was also provided for each problem.
